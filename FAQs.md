### Answers to Rationale/Subjective Questions

- [Gulp]() vs [Grunt]()
    - [Solid resource for comparing](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/gulp-vs-grunt)
    - Gulp I've heard is faster and was much easier to integrate/use/extend
    - Grunt had zero security issues _(gulp had many thanks to nested dependencies)_

- [CSS](#) [IDs](#) vs [Class(es)](#)
    - generally speaking if I use it once, and call it once (un-nested), it's an `ID`, otherwise it's a `Class`

- Links/`HREF`s
    - generally speaking I value `title` attributes on my links for accessibility
    - I prefer genuine links to follow the following decorator standards:
        - single line: genuine links that take you somewhere else on the web
        - double line: internal links that don't take you anywhere external
        - dashed line: tend to be thickest of all, non-genuine links, _(most likely span tags)_, indicating a tooltip
        - wavy line: internal links that don't take you anywhere external
